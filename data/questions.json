    "D. Firewall rule attached to the VM is blocking the request"
  ],
  "answer": {
    "correct": "B. Metadata-Flavor: Google header is missing",
    "explanation": "While querying metadata of an instance you must provide the header “Metadata-Flavor: Google”. This header indicates that the request was sent with the intention of retrieving metadata values, rather than unintentionally from an insecure source, and allows the metadata server to return the data you requested. If you do not provide this header, the metadata server denies your request."
